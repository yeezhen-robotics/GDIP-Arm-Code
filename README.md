# GDIP-Arm-Code
Robot arm implemented in arduino involving teach, autonomous &amp; homing paradigms. This project is an implementation of a medical vial transportation module for the GDIP third year module at UWE. In this repository lies arduino code to be flashed onto two arduino stations relating to the custom controller and robot arm. Transmission_test (Receiver) and Transmission_test_true (Transmitter) are both test code that was used to troubleshoot the antennas for functionality.
